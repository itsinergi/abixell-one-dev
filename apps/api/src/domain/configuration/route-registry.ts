/**
 * Route registry — the code-owned canonical list of every client route in the
 * application dictionary (Epic 2 Wave 1, CORE-ROADMAP.md §4.2 and §4.3).
 *
 * Locked decision (ADR-0014, §4.2): "Inti di kode, penimpa di database" —
 * core definitions live in code and are reviewed with the migration; tenant
 * overrides come later. This file IS the core definition. It is seeded into
 * `app_windows` (one row per route, per tenant) by the tenant trigger and the
 * backfill in 1787200000000_epic-2-wave-1-route-auto-registration.cjs.
 *
 * The same data is mirrored for the browser at
 * `apps/web/src/lib/routeRegistry.ts`; the parity test in
 * `apps/api/tests/route-registry-parity.test.ts` keeps the two in step.
 *
 * Two jobs this supports:
 *   1. Auto-registration — every route gets a window row automatically, so a
 *      page does not have to be manually entered to exist in the dictionary.
 *   2. The route guard (Epic 3) — the dictionary is the only place a route's
 *      required permission is declared. A route absent from this file is
 *      `belum_terdaftar` and, per §4.2 principle 6, cannot be role-locked.
 *
 * Status values (§4.3 "Status resmi setiap route"):
 *   - `di_menu`         — a normal working page; appears in nav and in the
 *                         role screen. (Roadmap: `di-menu`.)
 *   - `tersembunyi`     — a form, detail page, or tool page; hidden from nav
 *                         but STILL permission-checked.
 *   - `belum_terdaftar` — route exists with no status yet. Not role-lockable.
 *                         Reported for follow-up, not silently allowed through.
 *
 * `permissions` is "any of": the route resolves when the user holds at least
 * one code. An empty array means the route is authenticated-only (e.g. the
 * personal profile page) — it still requires a session, just no capability.
 *
 * Detail routes inherit their parent's access (§4.3 "Halaman rincian ...
 * mewarisi aksesnya"), so their permission list is repeated from the parent
 * rather than resolved at runtime — an explicit copy keeps the registry
 * readable and diffable.
 *
 * §4.3 open item 3 ("rincian mana saja yang memang perlu pengecualian
 * hanya-baca") was audited 2026-09-26 across the registry's detail routes
 * (parentPath set). The measurement:
 *
 *   - 15 of 17 detail routes repeat their parent's list verbatim.
 *   - `/asset-maintenance/assets/:assetId` is admitted by a different
 *     capability set: meters, downtime, and performance analytics rather
 *     than the maintenance list. Test roles OPERATOR_ROLE and NO_ANALYTICS_ROLE
 *     show the distinction: the former holds `asset.meter.manage` and
 *     `asset.analytics.read`; the latter holds only `asset.maintenance.read`.
 *   - `/hse/report` is the second and only other deviation: the server gates
 *     the create form on `hse.report` (hse.service.ts:110), not `hse.manage`,
 *     so both codes are listed — an admission correction, not a mode change.
 *   - No detail page is read-only. `/finance/transactions/:transactionId`, the
 *     route the roadmap names by hand, writes through `finance.manage` and
 *     `finance.approve`.
 *
 * What the audit does NOT support is the conclusion first drawn from it — that
 * a read-only exception has no reason to exist. Page capability and role
 * permission are different questions. That a page contains mutations says
 * nothing about whether a given role may perform them; a role holding only
 * `*.read` must be able to open the page and not write, and today nothing
 * expresses that. `permissions` here answers "may the role open the Window at
 * all" — it cannot answer "read-only". That is the third layer, the per-role
 * window lock `role_window_access` (§4.4 Gelombang 1), which is why the roadmap
 * added it and why this registry cannot carry the exception alone.
 *
 * `role_window_access` has landed (Epic 4 Wave 1) and is enforced: step 11b
 * maps each mutating API path to a Window in `window-enforcement.ts`, and
 * `window-access-plugin.ts` rejects POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with a 403 when every
 * authorization-effective assignment for that Window is read-only. The route
 * gate still decides whether the page renders.
 *
 * One residue was left by the historical seed, and it was visible. `1787200000000`
 * seeded this route's `note` as "Read-only exception (§4.3): own window identity
 * so it can be locked apart from the list." That note is copied into
 * `app_windows.description` by `config_seed_app_windows_for_tenant()`, and
 * `GET /app-metadata/windows` returns the column — so the wrong framing reached
 * the Application Dictionary for every existing and future tenant, not just this
 * file. The migration is historical (project policy freezes 1755500000000 through
 * 1787600000000), so `1787900000000_epic-3-route-note-correction.cjs` repairs it
 * forward: an UPDATE for existing tenants and a corrected trigger function for
 * future ones. The `note` above is the source-of-truth wording; the registry
 * carries it, the migration restores it in the database.
 *
 * Not digested by the boundary validator — `PHASE_11A_MIGRATION_DIGESTS` ends at
 * `1772000000000`. The freeze on the historical range is a project instruction,
 * not a validator rule.
