   * Anchored on `authorization_effective_user_role_assignments` for the same
   * reason every other predicate here is: an assignment whose scope was
   * invalidated, whose Role was revoked, or whose User is inactive or deleted
   * must not confer a write. Reading `user_role_assignments` directly would
   * let a revoked Role keep writing until the next login.
   *
   * One query, two answers, so the caller cannot observe a state the database
   * never had. `configured` and `writable` are aggregated over the same row
   * set: a Window with no configured Role stays outside the lock entirely
   * (absence is not read-only), and a single writable, active assignment is
   * enough however many read-only ones the user also holds (union allow).
   *
   * `scope_type` is deliberately not filtered here, unlike the tenant-scope
   * permission predicates above. The Window lock is a per-Window mode, not a
   * data-scope grant; the scope layer is a separate question answered
   * elsewhere, and intersecting them here would silently narrow the lock.

   * them away with no trace; deactivation keeps its rows, so only LIVE ones
   * matter — a revoked or scope-invalidated row grants nothing and must not
   * make a Role undeactivatable.
   *
   * The reference count on its own covers the lockout risk. A Role holding
   * Role-definition authority does so through an effective assignment, and an
   * effective assignment is live, so the last manager is already inside this
   * count. Checking `roleDefinitionAuthorityCountSql` on top would re-derive
   * the same refusal from a narrower population.
   *
   * Both directions are idempotent: asking for the state the Role is already
   * in returns the stored definition without advancing `version` or writing an
   * audit row, for the same reason the definition no-op path does — a token
   * that moves on nothing invalidates other administrators' previews for free.
