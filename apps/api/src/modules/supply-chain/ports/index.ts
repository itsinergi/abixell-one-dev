/**
 * Supply Chain Ports — Anti-Corruption Layer barrel.
 *
 * Re-exports the port interfaces and PostgreSQL implementations that
 * decouple the Warehouse Management (WMS) and Procurement Management
 * bounded contexts from Shared Master Data and the ADR-0023 outbox.
 *
 * Boundary discipline: this folder (`ports/`) lives under
 * `apps/api/src/modules/supply-chain/` so it satisfies the
 * `platform-boundary-validator` module-name rule while keeping the
 * ACL contracts physically adjacent to the contexts that consume them.
