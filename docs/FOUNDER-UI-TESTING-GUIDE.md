# Founder UI Testing Guide

Use this guide to open the current Abixell One Pilot build locally, sign in with the seeded demo administrator, and smoke-test the completed Core modules. The account and password below are for local/demo data only; they must never be reused as deployed-environment credentials.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Windows 11
- Docker Desktop running with Linux containers
- Node.js 20 or later
- Ports `5432`, `4000`, and `5173` available
- Repository at `D:\Abixell One - By Insting Tekno Sinergi\abixell-one`

## 2. Recommended one-click start

1. Start Docker Desktop and wait until its engine reports that it is running.
2. Open `D:\Abixell One - By Insting Tekno Sinergi\RUN-ABIXELL-ONE.bat`.
3. Leave the two terminal windows named **Abixell One API** and **Abixell One Web** open.
4. The launcher opens `http://localhost:5173` automatically. If it does not, open that URL manually.

The launcher is intentionally outside the repository and beside the `abixell-one` folder. It resolves the repository relative to its own location; it does not depend on a second hard-coded checkout path. On each run it:

1. verifies Docker and Node.js;
2. creates `apps\api\.env` from `.env.example` only if the local file is absent;
3. installs dependencies when `node_modules` is absent;
4. starts PostgreSQL;
5. applies pending migrations;
6. runs the idempotent demo seed and full-access permission sync; and
7. starts the API on port `4000` and the Web app on port `5173`.

## 3. Login

Open `http://localhost:5173/login` and use:

| Field | Local/demo value |
|---|---|
| Tenant code | `demo-gs` |
| Email | `admin@demo.local` |
| Password | `Admin12345!` |

Successful login redirects to `http://localhost:5173/` and displays **Welcome to Demo Enterprise Client**. The demo administrator is tenant-scoped and has the full-access role, so all capability-gated internal Core pages are available.

## 4. Core UI smoke route

Start from **Overview**. Open each page below and confirm its heading or principal content renders without an error banner. Empty tables are acceptable; a page load, visible controls, and no authorization/network error constitute a successful navigation smoke check.

| Completed Core area | Click or open | Expected success signal |
|---|---|---|
| Customer & Commercial | **Customers** (`/customer-commercial`) | **Customer & Commercial** heading; Customers, Contacts, Contracts, Projects, Sites, Services, and Assignments sections load |
| Complaints / Service Quality | **Queue** (`/queue`) | **Complaint Queue** heading and summary cards/list load |
| Complaints verification | **Verification** (`/verification`) | Verification queue loads |
| Complaints management | **Management** (`/management`) | Complaint performance dashboard loads |
| Survey | **Surveys** (`/surveys`) | **Surveys** heading and survey-definition list load |
| Service Operations | **Work Orders** (`/work-orders`) | **Work Orders** heading and create/list controls load |
| Service Operations configuration | **Service Types** (`/service-types`) | Service definition page loads |
| Workforce | **Employees** (`/employees`) | **Employees** heading and employee list/form load |
| Supply Chain | **Items & Stock** (`/items`) | **Items & Stock** heading and item/stock controls load |
| Supply Chain | **Suppliers** (`/suppliers`) | Supplier page loads |
| Supply Chain | **Purchasing** (`/purchasing`) | Purchasing page loads |
| Asset | **Assets** (`/assets`) | **Assets** heading and asset register controls load |
| Finance | **Transactions** (`/finance/transactions`) | **Transactions** heading and transaction controls load |
| Finance | **Cashflow** (`/finance/cashflow`) | Cashflow summary loads |
| Finance | **Cash & Bank** (`/finance/accounts`) | Account list/configuration loads |
| HSE | Open `http://localhost:5173/hse` | **HSE Register** heading and incident/observation filters load |
| Project Delivery | **Project Delivery** (`/project-delivery`) | **Project Delivery** heading and delivery list load |
| Reporting | **Reporting** (`/reporting`) | **Reporting** heading and operational reporting/dashboard controls load |

The HSE Core route is available to the full-access demo administrator. In the current shell it is reached directly at `/hse` rather than through an Overview/navigation card; this smoke instruction does not add or imply a new capability.

The **Complaints** customer-facing page is intentionally hidden from this internal tenant-wide administrator because that navigation item requires customer Data Scope. Use **Queue**, **Verification**, and **Management** for the administrator-side Service Quality smoke check. This is expected capability-gate behavior, not a missing permission.

## 5. What success looks like

The local Pilot UI smoke is successful when:

- login reaches **Welcome to Demo Enterprise Client**;
- all Core routes listed above render their expected headings or controls;
- no page shows `Unauthorized`, `Forbidden`, `Could not load`, or a network failure;
- browser refresh keeps the authenticated session; and
- **Sign out** returns to `/login` and the protected pages remain inaccessible after refresh.

This check verifies local login, capability-gated navigation, and page loading. It is not user-acceptance testing of every create/update workflow and does not represent production deployment approval.

## 6. Manual start fallback

If the launcher closes with an error, open a terminal in the repository and run these commands in order:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run db:up
```

```bash
npm run migrate -w apps/api
```

```bash
npm run seed -w apps/api
```

```bash
npm run sync-permissions -w apps/api
```

Then keep two terminals open. In the first:

```bash
npm run dev:api
```

In the second:

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/login` and use the demo credentials above. The seed is safe to rerun locally: if `demo-gs` already exists it reports that the seed was skipped, while permission sync reports zero additions when already current.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Docker or database startup fails

- Start or restart Docker Desktop.
- Confirm no unrelated process occupies port `5432`.
- Retry the launcher after the Docker engine is ready.
- Inspect the PostgreSQL container with `docker compose -f infra/postgres/docker-compose.yml ps` from the repository.

### Login reports invalid credentials

- Confirm tenant code, email, and password match the table exactly.
- Confirm the API terminal is still running on port `4000`.
- Rerun the migration, seed, and permission-sync commands in section 6.
- The seed deliberately does not overwrite an existing tenant. If a local database was manually modified, use a fresh local development database rather than changing seed credentials or adding production secrets to source control.

### Web page does not open

- Confirm the Web terminal shows Vite listening on `http://localhost:5173`.
- Confirm the API terminal is listening on `http://localhost:4000`.
- Close stale dev-server terminals before restarting the launcher if either port is already occupied.

### A page is missing from navigation

The shell hides pages that the signed-in user's permissions or Data Scope do not cover. For this guide, use `admin@demo.local`. The customer-facing **Complaints** item is intentionally customer-scope-only; the HSE smoke route is opened directly as documented above.

## Scope boundary

This guide covers local Pilot UI readiness only. Phase H2 production work (`PH-3`, `PH-4`, `PH-8`), Advanced waves, client extensions, and new roadmap capabilities remain outside this activity and remain unstarted.
